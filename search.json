    "section": "",
    "text": "Indeed, when the conversation of “greatest on the planet” comes up, the narrative is continually dominated by Giannis Antetokounmpo, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, and even LeBron James, who Jokic himself recently graced with that accolade.\nPerhaps it’s a matter of fan fatigue, a byproduct of playing for a relatively small-market organization, or just the simple fact that he doesn’t possess a singular, electrifying attribute like Antetokounmpo’s freakish athletic ability or Curry’s cold-blooded deep shooting. Regardless, the center from Sombor, Serbia has been fighting tooth and nail for his place at the table with the greats since he came into the league during the latter superstar’s historic 73-9 MVP campaign.\nWhether or not he bores people to death with his slow, methodical pace, or fails to be taken seriously due to his humorous, carefree demeanor, after four straight All-Star selections and back-to-back MVP seasons, during which he’s posted some of the most jaw-dropping stats in the history of the league, it’s time we put some respect on this man’s name.\nWe start our journey with an overview of Jokic’s overall production. utilizing some of the more common all-in-one statistics used to calculate a player’s overall per-game impact.\nAccording to the “godfather of basketball analytics” and creator of the metric, John Hollinger, Player Efficiency Rating (PER) is a rating of a player’s per-minute productivity, factoring in their positive “box-score” contributions (i.e. baskets scored, assists, rebounds, steals, blocks) as well as negative contributions (missed shots, turnovers, fouls) to produce a number that generally ranges from 0 to 30. 15 is generally viewed as average-to-mediocre, while anything above around 23 is considered elite company.\nBox Plus/Minus (BPM) is another easy-to-comprehend advanced metric that takes into account box score contributions in addition to a player’s position and the team’s overall performance to estimate a player’s contribution in points above the league average per 100 possessions played. The average BPM is defined as 0.0 (an okay starter or good 6th man), while 5.0 and above is considered elite, 8.0 is MVP level and 10.0+ is all-time great.\nTaking both of these metrics into account, we plot every player in the league who played at or above the league-wide median of 43 games played (just over half of a full season), with the top 9 performers highlighted.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(cowplot)\nlibrary(ggalt)\n\nadvlogs <- read_csv(\"advancedlogs21.csv\")\nadvplayers <- advlogs %>% filter(G >= 43)\nadvelites <- advplayers%>% filter(BPM > 5, PER > 23)\n\nalltimeper <- read_csv(\"alltimeper.csv\")\nalltimebpm <- read_csv(\"alltimebpm.csv\")\nalltimersadv <- alltimebpm %>% inner_join(alltimeper, by=c(\"Player\"))\n\njokeradv <- advelites %>% filter(Player == \"Nikola Jokic\")\nfreakadv <- advelites %>% filter(Player == \"Giannis Antetokounmpo\")\nprocessadv <- advelites %>% filter(Player == \"Joel Embiid\")\nkingadv <- advelites %>% filter(Player == \"LeBron James\")\nsniperadv <- advelites %>% filter(Player == \"Kevin Durant\")\nbucketsadv <- advelites %>% filter(Player == \"Jimmy Butler\")\nlukaadv <- advelites %>% filter(Player == \"Luka Doncic\")\niceadv <- advelites %>% filter(Player == \"Trae Young\")\njaadv <- advelites %>% filter(Player == \"Ja Morant\")\n\nfreakalltimeadv <- alltimersadv %>% filter(Player == \"Giannis Antetokounmpo (2021-22)\")\nprocessalltimeadv <- alltimersadv %>% filter(Player == \"Joel Embiid (2021-22)\")\njokeralltimeadv <- alltimersadv %>% filter(Player == \"Nikola Jokic (2021-22)\")\nchefalltimeadv <- alltimersadv %>% filter(Player == \"Stephen Curry (2015-16)\")\nkingalltimeadv <- alltimersadv %>% filter(Player == \"LeBron James (2008-09)\")\nmjalltimeadv <- alltimersadv %>% filter(Player == \"Michael Jordan (1987-88)\")\nmjalltimeadv2 <- alltimersadv %>% filter(Player == \"Michael Jordan (1990-91)\")\nkingalltimeadv2 <- alltimersadv %>% filter(Player == \"LeBron James (2012-13)\")\nfreakalltimeadv2 <- alltimersadv %>% filter(Player == \"Giannis Antetokounmpo (2019-20)\")\njokeralltimeadv2 <- alltimersadv %>% filter(Player == \"Nikola Jokic (2020-21)\")\nadmiralalltimeadv <- alltimersadv %>% filter(Player == \"David Robinson (1993-94)\")\nrussalltimeadv <- alltimersadv %>% filter(Player == \"Russell Westbrook (2016-17)\")\nalltimeadv <- bind_rows(chefalltimeadv, kingalltimeadv, mjalltimeadv, admiralalltimeadv, russalltimeadv, freakalltimeadv, processalltimeadv, jokeralltimeadv, mjalltimeadv2, kingalltimeadv2, freakalltimeadv2, jokeralltimeadv2)\n\nggplot() + geom_point(data = advplayers, aes(x = BPM, y = PER), color = \"grey\") + \n  geom_point(data = jokeradv, aes(x = BPM, y = PER), color = \"dark blue\", size = 2) + \n  geom_point(data = freakadv, aes(x = BPM, y = PER), color = \"dark green\", size = 2) +\n  geom_point(data = processadv, aes(x = BPM, y = PER), color = \"blue\", size = 2) +\n  geom_point(data = kingadv, aes(x = BPM, y = PER), color = \"gold\", size = 2) +\n  geom_point(data = sniperadv, aes(x = BPM, y = PER), color = \"black\", size = 2) +\n  geom_point(data = bucketsadv, aes(x = BPM, y = PER), color = \"dark red\", size = 2) +\n  geom_point(data = lukaadv, aes(x = BPM, y = PER), color = \"light blue\", size = 2) +\n  geom_point(data = iceadv, aes(x = BPM, y = PER), color = \"yellow green\", size = 2) +\n  geom_point(data = jaadv, aes(x = BPM, y = PER), color = \"steel blue\", size = 2) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=advelites, \n    aes(x=BPM, y=PER, label=Player), box.padding = .5, size = 3.3) +\n  geom_encircle(data=jokeradv, aes(x=BPM, y=PER), s_shape=0, expand=.01, colour=\"red\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Among his peers, Jokic was a freakish outlier\",\n    subtitle = \"2021-22 all-in-one box-score stats show an otherwordly level of production from the center.\",\n    caption = \"Data from basketball-reference.com | By: Sawyer Belair\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Box Plus-Minus (BPM)\", y = \"Player Efficiency Rating (PER)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\", ### Aligns the title to the left\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 9), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=12), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see, the distribution demonstrates a tight positive correlation between the two metrics, unsurprisingly given their adjacency to one another. An off-season from Curry (aside from a championship and Finals MVP to end the year) kept him out of the league’s top echelon, and only Antetokounmpo and Joel Embiid, Jokic’s counterparts at the top of the pecking order among the league’s big men, truly gave him a run for his money.\nAntetokounmpo and Jokic both posted all-time great seasons, shattering the 10.0 BPM threshold, but Jokic’s 13.7 is absolutely unfathomable, even in the context of some of the greatest seasons in the league’s history.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data = alltimersadv, aes(x = BPM, y = PER), color = \"grey\") +\n  geom_point(data = jokeralltimeadv, aes(x = BPM, y = PER), color = \"dark blue\", size = 2) + \n  geom_point(data = freakalltimeadv, aes(x = BPM, y = PER), color = \"dark green\", size = 2) +\n  geom_point(data = chefalltimeadv, aes(x = BPM, y = PER), color = \"gold\", size = 2) +\n  geom_point(data = kingalltimeadv, aes(x = BPM, y = PER), color = \"maroon\", size = 2) +\n  geom_point(data = mjalltimeadv, aes(x = BPM, y = PER), color = \"red\", size = 2) +\n  geom_point(data = admiralalltimeadv, aes(x = BPM, y = PER), color = \"black\", size = 2) +\n  geom_point(data = russalltimeadv, aes(x = BPM, y = PER), color = \"orange\", size = 2) +\n  geom_point(data = mjalltimeadv2, aes(x = BPM, y = PER), color = \"red\", size = 2) +\n  geom_point(data = kingalltimeadv2, aes(x = BPM, y = PER), color = \"maroon\", size = 2) +\n  geom_point(data = freakalltimeadv2, aes(x = BPM, y = PER), color = \"dark green\", size = 2) +\n  geom_point(data = jokeralltimeadv2, aes(x = BPM, y = PER), color = \"dark blue\", size = 2) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data = alltimeadv, aes(x=BPM, y=PER, label = Player), box.padding = .6, size = 3.3) + \n  geom_encircle(data=jokeralltimeadv, aes(x=BPM, y=PER), s_shape=0, expand=.01, colour=\"red\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"A historically productive season\",\n    subtitle = \"Even amongst the greatest individual seasons on record, Jokic stands alone.\",\n    caption = \"Data from basketball-reference.com | By: Sawyer Belair\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 9), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=12), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nEven at their respective peaks, Michael Jordan and LeBron James, the presumptive “greatest players of all-time” who are subject to endless and often fruitless debates over who is better than the other, never even sniffed the level of productivity Jokic turned in last season. Nor did Curry during the aforementioned 73-win 2015-16 season that was also Jokic’s first in the league, coming in as a relative unknown after infamously being drafted 41st overall during a Taco Bell commercial.\nI’ll repeat that again, the man who just won back-to-back MVPs and left MJ and LeBron in the dust was just half a decade ago drafted off-screen during a Taco Bell commercial!!\nMoving on, we take a look at Jokic’s shot-selection relative to his modern-day peers. While much is said about his virtuoso passing ability, especially for a player of his size, perhaps the most crippling aspect of the Joker’s game is his ability to score at will no matter where he is on the court.\nComparing him again to the other top 8 players in PER and BPM last season, we see that while Jokic owns the space from 3-to-10 feet from the basket that is so often overlooked in the modern NBA, he’s also converting his shots at an unprecedented rate from everywhere else as well.\nIn terms of raw efficiency across the court, Jokic’s only contemporary is Kevin Durant, who is often described as the league’s greatest scorer for his ability to drop the ball in the hoop from anywhere at anytime. Although the two play at considerably different levels of pace, the exact same can be said of Jokic.\n\n\nCode\nshtlogs <- read_csv(\"shootinglogs21.csv\")\nshtplayers <- shtlogs %>% filter(G >= 43)\njokersht <- shtplayers %>% filter(Player == \"Nikola Jokic\")\nfreaksht <- shtplayers %>% filter(Player == \"Giannis Antetokounmpo\")\nprocesssht <- shtplayers %>% filter(Player == \"Joel Embiid\")\nkingsht <- shtplayers %>% filter(Player == \"LeBron James\")\nsnipersht <- shtplayers %>% filter(Player == \"Kevin Durant\")\nbucketssht <- shtplayers %>% filter(Player == \"Jimmy Butler\")\nlukasht <- shtplayers %>% filter(Player == \"Luka Doncic\")\nicesht <- shtplayers %>% filter(Player == \"Trae Young\")\njasht <- shtplayers %>% filter(Player == \"Ja Morant\")\nshtelites <- bind_rows(jokersht, freaksht, processsht, kingsht, snipersht, bucketssht, lukasht, icesht, jasht)\n\nshotchart <- shtelites  %>% select(Player, `at 0-3ft`, `at 3-10ft`, `at 10-16ft`, `at 16ft-3P`, `at 3P`)\nshotchartwide <- shotchart %>% pivot_longer(\n  cols = starts_with(\"at\"),\n  names_to = \"Distance\",\n  values_to = \"% from\"\n)\nshotchartwider <- read_csv(\"shotchartwider.csv\")\n\neffchart <- shtelites %>% select(Player, `0-3ft%`, `3-10ft%`, `10-16ft%`, `16ft-3P%`, `3P%`)\neffchartwide <- effchart %>% pivot_longer(\n  cols=ends_with(\"%\"), \n  names_to=\"Distance\",\n  values_to=\"FG%\"\n)\neffchartwider <- read_csv(\"effchartwider.csv\")\n\nshots <- ggplot() +\n    geom_bar(data = shotchartwider, aes(x=reorder(Player, -Sort), weight=`% from`, fill = Order)) +\n    scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"green\", \"yellow\", \"orange\", \"red\"), labels = c(\"3P\", \"16ft-3P\", \"10-16ft\", \"3-10ft\", \"0-3ft\")) +\n    coord_flip() + \n    labs(\n      title = \"A threat from anywhere on the floor\",\n    subtitle = \"Jokic was nearly unrivaled in high-volume efficiency at every distance from the basket.\",\n      x=\"\", y=\"% of shots attempted\") + theme_minimal() +\n     theme(\n       plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n       plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n       axis.title = element_text(size = 9), \n       plot.subtitle = element_text(size=12), \n       panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n     )\n  \neff <- ggplot() +\n    geom_bar(data = effchartwider, aes(x=reorder(Player, `FG%`), weight=`FG%`, fill = Order)) +\n    scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"green\", \"yellow\", \"orange\", \"red\"), labels = c(\"3P\", \"16ft-3P\", \"10-16ft\", \"3-10ft\", \"0-3ft\")) +\n    labs(\n    caption = \"Data from basketball-reference.com | By: Sawyer Belair\",\n      x=\"\", y=\"% Efficiency\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 9), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  ) +\n    coord_flip()\n  \n  plot_grid(shots, eff, ncol = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\nOne aspect that Jokic isn’t given enough credit for, but which almost certainly factored into him winning a second-straight MVP award, is his effort on the defensive end. Much has been said in the past about the two-time MVP’s ineffectiveness with his back to the basket, but his defensive improvement his year has been absolutely astounding.\nDefensive performance is notoriously difficult to quantify in basketball, with the metrics capable of doing so often difficult for the casual fan to comprehend (although Jokic excels in many of them, such as RAPTOR). While it’s far from a perfect statistic, win shares are a relatively easy-to-understand metric that, quite simply, calculate how many wins a player can be credited with adding to a team’s season.\nListed below are the top defenders from the 2021-22 season, with the 3 finalists for Defensive Player of the Year marked with an asterisk(*).\n\n\nCode\nwinshares <- read_csv(\"winshares.csv\")\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data = winshares, \n    aes(y = reorder(Player, DWS), x = DWS, xend = OWS),\n    size = 2, \n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"blue\",\n    colour_xend = \"orange\") + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Jokic among the best on both ends of the court\",\n    subtitle = \"Team-contribution metrics show the center's impact on winning isn't limited to his offense.\",\n    caption = \"Data from basketball-reference.com | By: Sawyer Belair\",\n    x = \"Defensive win shares (blue) vs. Offensive win shares (orange) \", y = \"\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\", ### Aligns the title to the left\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 9), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=12)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite anchoring a 15th-ranked defense that boasted an elite-level defensive rating of 103.7 with him on the floor and a league-worst 114.8 with him on the bench, in addition to tallying a league-best 4.5 Defensive Win Shares (DWS), Jokic is rarely credited with shouldering the burden on defense, unlike his fellow MVP finalists in Embiid and Antetokounmpo.\nThe latter two also produced significantly on the offensive end of the floor, but one can’t help but wonder if Jokic’s own unfathomable level of offensive production (further evidenced by his league-best 10.8 Offensive Win Shares), in conjunction with his pasty complexion and stocky frame, has served to distract from his legitimate dominance on defense.\nNonetheless, the quandary of Jokic’s underrated defense is simply further evidence of a broader truth; since the moment he set foot in the league, he has been subject to dismissal on the basis of surface-level evaluations. Nonetheless, at 284 lbs and 6’11”, Nikola Jokic takes the ball down the court and runs the offense like a point guard. Despite being a slow, lumbering giant, he’s able to score over anyone, anytime, anywhere on the floor. While a carefree jokester at heart with a knack for unconventional thinking, he’s also a tough-as-nails bruiser, battling night in and night out for the simple love of the game.\nJokic is a man who thrives on being underestimated, and making people pay for doing so.\nAnd so, the bottom line: dismiss the greatness of Nikola Jokic at your own peril. He’ll just keep proving you wrong anyway."

    "title": "Why the Denver Broncos have been so bad since winning Super Bowl 50",
    "section": "",
    "text": "But why, exactly, have the Broncos been so god-awful over the course of the past 6 years? As a self-loathing lifelong Broncos fan, I set out to answer this simple question.\nAfter two trips to the Super Bowl in a 3 year span, and cultivating a reputation as one of the league’s perennial title contenders in the early, Denver has missed the playoffs in 6 (and soon to be 7) consecutive seasons, and seems utterly incapable of escaping its endless struggle to draft talent at the quarterback position, despite a brief 4-season pause on the issue with Hall-of-Famer Peyton Manning under center.\nWhether this more recent episode is because of president of football operations John Elway’s obsession with tall, but not necessarily skilled, signal callers, a run of bad luck, or the sheer cruelty wrought upon this organization by the football gods, the team’s QB struggles have translated into an offense that is middling at best despite often being stocked with stud players like wide receivers Courtland Sutton and Jerry Jeudy and 2020 2nd- Team All-Pro tackle Garrett Bolles.\nAll of this has happened while the Broncos often boast one of the premiere defensive squads in the league, a fact which played a large role in the team’s brutal 24-10 slogging of the 17-1 Panthers in Super Bowl 50, and which has likely been the only thing keeping the team from descending into “2017 0-16 Cleveland Browns” levels of hopelessness.\nThis inconsistency can easily be visualized by looking at Pro Football Reference’s Simple Rating System, which takes into account a team’s point differential and strength of schedule to produce a context-independent ranking for every team’s offense, defense, and overall effectiveness, with 0.0 denoting a completely mediocre team, positive values being good and negative values being, well, negative.\nLet’s take a look at the Offensive Simple Rating System for each of past Super Bowl winners since 2016.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(rvest)\nlibrary(cowplot)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nnfl15 <- read_csv(\"nfl15.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2015)\nnfl16 <- read_csv(\"nfl16.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2016)\nnfl17 <- read_csv(\"nfl17.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2017)\nnfl18 <- read_csv(\"nfl18.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2018)\nnfl19 <- read_csv(\"nfl19.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2019)\nnfl20 <- read_csv(\"nfl20.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2020)\nnfl21 <- read_csv(\"nfl21.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2021)\n\nnfl <- bind_rows(nfl15, nfl16, nfl17, nfl18, nfl19, nfl20, nfl21)\n\nnflclean <- nfl %>% mutate(Tm = gsub(\"*\", \"\", Tm, fixed = TRUE)) %>% mutate(Tm = gsub(\"+\", \"\", Tm, fixed = TRUE)) %>% mutate(Tm = gsub(\"Redskins\", \"Commanders\", Tm, fixed = TRUE))\n\nden <- nflclean %>% filter(Tm == \"Denver Broncos\")\nkc <- nflclean %>% filter(Tm == \"Kansas City Chiefs\")\nne <- nflclean %>% filter(Tm == \"New England Patriots\")\nlar <- nflclean %>% filter(Tm == \"Los Angeles Rams\")\ntb <- nflclean %>% filter(Tm == \"Tampa Bay Buccaneers\")\nphi <- nflclean %>% filter(Tm == \"Philadelphia Eagles\")\nteams <- bind_rows(den, kc, ne, lar, tb, phi)\n\navwins <- nflclean %>% group_by(Season) %>% summarize(winsavg = mean(W))\n\nnflsumd <- nflclean %>% \n  filter(Season > 2015) %>%\n  group_by(Tm) %>% \n  summarize(\n    wins = sum(W),\n    SoSav = mean(SoS),\n    MoVav = mean(MoV),\n    OSRSav = mean(OSRS),\n    DSRSav = mean(DSRS)\n    )\n\ndensumd <- nflsumd %>% filter(Tm == \"Denver Broncos\")\nkcsumd <- nflsumd %>% filter(Tm == \"Kansas City Chiefs\")\nnesumd <- nflsumd %>% filter(Tm == \"New England Patriots\")\nlarsumd <- nflsumd %>% filter(Tm == \"Los Angeles Rams\")\ntbsumd <- nflsumd %>% filter(Tm == \"Tampa Bay Buccaneers\")\nphisumd <- nflsumd %>% filter(Tm == \"Philadelphia Eagles\")\nteamsumd <- bind_rows(densumd, kcsumd, nesumd, larsumd, tbsumd, phisumd)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=teams, aes(x=Season, y=OSRS, group=Tm, color=Tm), label=\"OSRS\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"dark orange\", \"red\", \"gold\", \"dark blue\", \"seagreen\", \"burlywood4\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-10, 13)) +\n  facet_wrap(~Tm, scales='free') + \n  labs(\n    title = \"All downhill from here\",\n    subtitle = \"Largely thanks to an ever-worsening offense, the Broncos have failed to produce a winning record since 2016.\",\n    y = \"Wins\",\n    color = \"\"\n    ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n      plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n      plot.title = element_text(size = 17, face = \"bold\"),\n      axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n      plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n      panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n      legend.position = \"none\"\n     )\n\n\n\n\n\nGoing in, I was expecting to see a constantly fluctuating line for the Bronco offense, but I was surprisingly mistaken. As we can see, there are no fits and spurts of offensive brilliance from Denver, even during their 2021 season that, despite a handful of narrow losses, left many fans hopeful for 2022 (no comment).\nInstead, the offense just gets progressively worse with every year that drags on, begging to be put out of its misery by Broncos GM George Patton. Boy can I relate.\nBut surely that vaunted defense of Denver’s, once dubbed the “No Fly Zone” by league menace and former Broncos cornerback Aqib Talib, has given a more definitive showing of itself over the past half-decade?\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=teams, aes(x=Season, y=DSRS, group=Tm, color=Tm), label=\"DSRS\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"dark orange\", \"red\", \"gold\", \"dark blue\", \"seagreen\", \"burlywood4\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-10, 13)) +\n  facet_wrap(~Tm, scales='free') + \n  labs(\n    title = \"A surprisingly inconsistent defense\",\n    subtitle = \"The defense has repeatedly alternated between below-average and stellar since 2015.\",\n    y = \"Wins\",\n    color = \"\"\n    ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n      plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n      plot.title = element_text(size = 17, face = \"bold\"),\n      axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n      plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n      panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n      legend.position = \"none\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nAaaand I was wrong again. Perhaps most horrifying of all, the numbers seem to suggest that the Broncos D hasn’t been much better than the notoriously squishy Chiefs defense. Don’t even get me started on the Patriots, who’ve led the league in average Defensive Simple Rating System since 2015 with a whopping 4.2 to Denver’s 5th-ranked 1.9 and the Chiefs in 9th at 1.2.\nMoving on as I force the pain down, we take a closer look at the Broncos’ cumulative point differential over the past 8 seasons.\nA notably agonizing aspect of the Broncos’ seemingly inevitable struggles since Super Bowl 50 has been their strong performance in the first several games of many seasons. Most notably, the team made strong showings to start the 2016, 2017 and 2021 seasons, and I was curious to see how their ability to run up the score on their opponents diminished over the course of each season as the schedule wore on.\n\n\nCode\nyears <- 2015:2022\n\npdbroncos <- tibble()\n\nfor (i in years){\n\nurl <- paste0(\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/den/\", i, \".htm\")\n\nstats <- url %>% \n  read_html() %>% \n  html_nodes(xpath = '//*[@id=\"games\"]') %>% \n  html_table(header=FALSE)\nstats <- stats[[1]] %>% rename(Week=X1, TmScore=X11, OppScore=X12) %>% filter(Week != \"Week\" & TmScore != \"Score\" & TmScore != \"\") %>% select(-starts_with(\"X\")) %>% mutate_at(vars(-Week), as.numeric) %>% mutate(PD = TmScore - OppScore) %>% mutate(cumPD = cumsum(PD)) %>% mutate(Year = i)\n\npdbroncos <- bind_rows(pdbroncos, stats)\n\nSys.sleep(2)\n}\n\npdbroncos <- pdbroncos %>% mutate(Week = as.numeric(Week)) %>% filter(Week > 0) %>% mutate(Year = as.character(Year))\n\npd2015 <- pdbroncos %>% filter(Year == 2015)\npd2016 <- pdbroncos %>% filter(Year == 2016)\npd2017 <- pdbroncos %>% filter(Year == 2017)\npd2018 <- pdbroncos %>% filter(Year == 2018)\npd2019 <- pdbroncos %>% filter(Year == 2019)\npd2020 <- pdbroncos %>% filter(Year == 2020)\npd2021 <- pdbroncos %>% filter(Year == 2021)\npd2022 <- pdbroncos %>% filter(Year == 2022)\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_hline(aes(yintercept=0)) +\n  geom_step(data = pdbroncos, aes(x = Week, y = cumPD, group = Year, color = Year)) +\n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"darkorange1\", \"dark blue\", \"tan\", \"deeppink1\", \"orchid4\", \"lightslateblue\", \"springgreen2\", \"mediumturquoise\", \"black\")) +\n   labs(\n    title = \"Consistency is key\",\n    subtitle = \"Despite a few hot starts in 2016, 2017 and 2021, the Broncos tend to lose steam by the halfway point.\",\n    x = \"Week\",\n    y = \"Cumulative point differential\",\n    color = \"Season\"\n    ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n       plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n       plot.title = element_text(size = 17, face = \"bold\"),\n       axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n      plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n       panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n     )\n\n\n\n\n\nOuch. That 2021 line hurts even now, and it’s telling of just how much potential that team had, starting the season 3-1 only to go on a 4-game losing streak that, despite a late-season rally, they never truly recovered from. There’s a whole lot of seasons on here that don’t even warrant discussion, but as we can see, the Broncos have a penchant for starting the season strong just to blow it all away with ease by the middle of the season.\nBut surely there’s an explanation for the Broncos’ struggles beyond mediocre quarterback play, an inconsistent defense and lackluster discipline, you say? Good god, I hope so.\nLet’s take a look at the other metric that factor into our Simple Rating System scores; strength of schedule.\nAs it suggests, strength of schedule determines the average quality of opponents a team faced in a given season was based off of the combined winning percentages for every team it faced that season. We’ll also look at the average per-game margin of victory for the Broncos and every other team in the league since 2015.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=nflsumd, aes(x=SoSav, y=MoVav, group=Tm, size=wins), alpha=.7, color=\"gray\") +\n  geom_point(data=kcsumd, aes(x=SoSav, y=MoVav, size=wins), alpha=.75, color =\"red\") +\n  geom_point(data=nesumd, aes(x=SoSav, y=MoVav, size=wins), alpha=.75, color =\"dark blue\") +\n  geom_point(data=larsumd, aes(x=SoSav, y=MoVav, size=wins), alpha=.75, color =\"gold\") +\n  geom_point(data=phisumd, aes(x=SoSav, y=MoVav, size=wins), alpha=.75, color =\"sea green\") +\n  geom_point(data=tbsumd, aes(x=SoSav, y=MoVav, size=wins), alpha=.75, color =\"burlywood4\") + \n  geom_point(data=densumd, aes(x=SoSav, y=MoVav, size=wins), alpha=.75, color =\"dark orange\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=0.85, y=9, label=\"Tough schedule, good performance\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=-0.9, y=5, label=\"Easy schedule, good performance\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=0.75, y=-7, label=\"Tough schedule, poor performance\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=-0.75, y=-2.5, label=\"Playing for draft picks\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=teamsumd, aes(x=SoSav, y=MoVav, label=Tm), box.padding = .35\n    ) + \n  labs(\n    title = \"It's not all their fault...right?\",\n    subtitle = \"2015-2021 per-season averages paint a slightly sympathetic picture of the Broncos' woes over that span.\",\n    x = \"Season-to-season strength of schedule\",\n    y = \"Per-game margin of victory\",\n    size = \"Wins\"\n    ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n       plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n       plot.title = element_text(size = 17, face = \"bold\"),\n       axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n      plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n       panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n     )\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether or not you’re a homer, you really do have to feel bad for the Broncos here. They’ve had the misfortune of sharing a division with the Chiefs, who have gone 13-0 against them since the former’s last Super Bowl win, and the two free wins they’re giving away every season might even have been enough in some years to get them into the playoffs if they’d been able to lock them down instead. But then again, not every team can skate to playoffs off 4-6 free wins every season like the Patriots have over the near-entirety of the 2010s (I’ll let the numbers speak for themselves here).\nLet’s not beat around the bush, though. The Broncos have been bad, really bad, and even an unforgiving schedule doesn’t discount just how dysfunctional they’ve been. Look no further than the absolute butt-fumble of a season the team has produced with Russell Wilson at the helm and first-time head coach Nathaniel Hackett twiddling his thumbs on the sidelines. The offensive numbers are worse than ever, with the team currently ranking dead last in the league in scoring offense at a gag-inducing 13.8 points per game, a whole 2 points less than the next worst offensive attack led by the Houston Texans.\nSo, Broncos fans, when you find yourself feeling down, desolate and utterly hopeless about the future prospects of this team, just remember one thing: at least we have the Denver Nuggets."
